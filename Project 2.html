<h2>My Rapid Development Project</h2>
<p><strong><u>Competency 2</u></strong>: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. </p>
<br><p><strong><u>Artifact: </u></strong><a href=" https://youtu.be/TUIZOifbe4Q"> Course Registration Simulation</a></p>
<br><p><strong><u>Reﬂection:</u></strong> In my previous job as an online academic advisor, one of my key responsibilities was to train new advisors on various advising processes, including discussing transfer credits, applying for graduation, and registering students for courses. To enhance this training, I created an online simulation using Adobe Captivate, which demonstrated how to process a student’s course registration. This simulation employed scaffolding techniques, providing a step-by-step tutorial followed by practice opportunities for the new advisors. </p>
    <br><p>Developing this simulation allowed me to showcase my ability to create engaging and effective training materials. It also pushed me to learn and utilize new technology, which presented several challenges. One significant challenge was mastering Adobe Captivate. I spent considerable time perfecting the timing and ensuring the simulation ran smoothly for the trainees. Balancing creativity with technical proficiency was difficult, and there were moments of frustration when things didn’t work as expected. However, these challenges taught me adaptability and critical thinking, which are invaluable in any project.
    <br><p>One of the strengths I discovered during this project was my ability to design interactive and userfriendly training experiences. The simulation not only provided clear instructions but also allowed new advisors to practice the process, reinforcing their learning.</p>
    <br><p>This project meets the department competency by applying systematic methods for analyzing instructional needs and designing effective training solutions. I identified the need for a comprehensive training tool for new advisors and developed the simulation to address this need. Additionally, I collected and analyzed feedback from users to make iterative improvements, ensuring the instructional product was both effective and user-friendly.</p>
    <br><p>Looking back, I realize I could have pushed myself further in mastering Adobe Captivate. Continuing to learn and apply these skills, especially in my current job, and tackling more complex projects would have helped me grow even more. Additionally, I would have liked to present the finished simulation to my organization for potential use in our training program, further validating its effectiveness and impact.</p>
    <br><p>Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that expanded my skill set and creativity, aligning with the department’s goals of developing innovative, accessible, and effective learning technologies. </p>
