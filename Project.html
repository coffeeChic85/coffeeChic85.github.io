<h2>My Digital Media Project</h2>
<p><strong><u>Competency 1:</u></strong> Students will develop theory and research-based skills for innovative, aesthetic, accessible, equitable, effective and sustainable design and development of technologies for learning opportunities and systems.</p>
<br><p><strong><u>Artifact: </u></strong><a href=" https://youtu.be/2BGSYYPZnyg?si=W-rs_mJ6i9fcsLW7"> Bird Watching Tutorial</a></p>
<br><p><strong><u>Reﬂection:</u></strong> Creating this online training module for novice bird watchers was an enriching experience. The module guides beginners through essential equipment and techniques, introduces technologies for bird identiﬁcation, and provides tips on creating environments that attract birds.
    This project allowed me to leverage digital media to enhance the learning experience, making it engaging and interactive. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, requiring me to use unfamiliar technologies. I learned to use Adobe products like Premiere Pro, Audition, and Photoshop to create dynamic content. This process highlighted both my strengths and weaknesses; I showcased my creative side but faced signiﬁcant challenges while learning the software.
    One major challenge was the steep learning curve of Adobe tools. I often found myself spending hours troubleshooting issues and watching tutorials. Balancing creativity with technical proﬁciency was difficult, and there were moments of frustration when things didn’t work as expected. However, these challenges taught me resilience and problem-solving skills.</p>
    <br><p>This project aligns with the department’s goals by fostering skills in designing and developing innovative, accessible, and effective learning technologies. By creating an engaging and inclusive module, I demonstrated my ability to craft educational experiences that are both aesthetically pleasing and equitable for diverse learners while utilizing different technologies.
    <br><p>Looking back, I realize I could have pushed myself further in mastering these tools. Continuing to learn and apply these skills, especially in my current job, and tackling more complex projects would have helped me grow even more. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that expanded my skill set and creativity.
