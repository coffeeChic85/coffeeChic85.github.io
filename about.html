<h2>Professional Me</h2>
<p> With over a decade of experience in higher education, I've journeyed from counseling to academic advising, and now I’m diving into the world of instructional design. <p>My academic adventures include a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a Master of Arts in Counseling, and I’m currently leveling up with a Master of Science in Learning Technology and Design, which I am projected to be degree complete by May 2025.</p> As an Instructional Designer I at Missouri University of Science and Technology, I get to team up with faculty to create learning experiences that are engaging and allow students to grow in their knowledge base.This has been a tough trasition since I am not naturally creative, but I know I can do it and it is an adventure I am willing to take.</p>

<br><h2>Personal Me</h2>
<p>When I’m not working, you’ll find me and my husband Wes exploring new corners of the globe— from the cobblestone streets of Europe to the vibrant culture of Cuba and the icy wonders of Iceland. Back at home, I love hiking, birdwatching, watching movies, and getting lost in a gripping murder mystery. And let’s not forget our two dogs, <em>Nate</em> and <em>Pongo</em>, who keep us on our toes with endless games of fetch and walk.</p>
