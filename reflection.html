                <p>Reflecting on my current role as an instructional designer in the Center for Teaching and Learning at a Missouri University of Science and Technology, I find myself at a pivotal point in my career. This position has provided me with invaluable experience in instructional design, even before completing my degree program. I’ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of creative tools, particularly those in the Adobe Creative Cloud, and have gained a little experience in web design by assisting with designing the website for our department’s professional conference, ITLC. However, my current position has made me realize that Instructional Design might not be the path for me. Working with faculty that are resistant to change and not respective to new teaching methods or technologies to improve the learning experience for students has been incredibly frustrating, which is making me shift my professional interest and goals to different career paths.</p>
                <p>My career goals are evolving as I gain more insight into my strengths and interests. I aspire to transition into a role as a learning and development instructional designer within the private industry. This shift would allow me to leverage my creative skills and experience in a new environment. Furthermore, I am keen on moving into project management where I can direct the f low of projects rather than just focusing on the design aspect. This would enable me to have a broader impact on the development and implementation of learning initiatives.</p>
                <p>In parallel with my professional experiences, my educational journey has been incredibly fulfilling. Pursuing my MS in Learning Technologies and Design has been a transformative experience. The project-based learning approach in each course has allowed me to tap into my creative side more than ever before, which is pushing me out of my comfort zone. This program has equipped me with hands-on experience in using creative technologies for digital media and web design, which are crucial for creating engaging learning experiences. Additionally, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the entire process of creating training programs or courses, from needs assessment to implementation.</p>
                <p>The decision to shift from working directly with students as an academic advisor to working with faculty as an instructional designer was driven by my desire to be more proactive in helping students. By assisting faculty with pedagogy and course engagement, I can indirectly enhance the learning experience for students. This proactive approach aligns with my long-term goal of making a significant impact in the field of education and training. As I continue to grow professionally and academically, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am committed to achieving my career aspirations.</p>
